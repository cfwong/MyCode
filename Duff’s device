“Duff’s device” is one - it’s written in C and does some rather weird things to “unwrap a loop” that copies data from one place to another very efficiently. Most C programmers take one look at it and are amazed that it even compiles - let alone be actual, legal C code!
send(to, from, count)
register short *to, *from;
register count;
{
    register n = (count + 7) / 8;
    switch (count % 8) {
    case 0: do { *to = *from++;
    case 7:      *to = *from++;
    case 6:      *to = *from++;
    case 5:      *to = *from++;
    case 4:      *to = *from++;
    case 3:      *to = *from++;
    case 2:      *to = *from++;
    case 1:      *to = *from++;
            } while (--n > 0);
    }
}
