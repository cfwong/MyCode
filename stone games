* The game starts with a number of piles of stones. The number of stones in each pile may not be equal.
* The players alternately pick up  or more stones from  pile
* The player to remove the last stone wins.
// strategy is to get a num-sum of 0 in every move, and if it is already 0, you lose
    static String nimGame(int[] pile) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int p: pile)
            res ^= p;
        return res==0? "Second": "First";
    }
